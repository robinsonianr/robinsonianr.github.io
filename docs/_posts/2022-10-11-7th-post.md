Tripoli Post #7

This week I did some research looking at ways to potentially save an SVG of the beam shape and g-beam shape line plots and use it as a thumbnail for the peak centre line plot. First I looked at Squid and looked at the WeightedMeanPlot class lines 990 - 1050 to get an idea of how it was used in Squid to produce an output of an SVG to a file. Within squid, it is used to create an SVG of the plot on the page and send it to one of the resource files in Squid, which can be opened in a browser or possibly used somewhere else if desired. Potentially, this feature can be used to take an SVG of the beam shape and g-beam shape line plots produced when I created the peak centre line plot. Doing this would be potentially easier and more efficient than trying to waste more resources creating another smaller canvas and redrawing the line plots again.

 Also, I looked at this oracle website [JavaFX Save Images](https://community.oracle.com/tech/developers/discussion/2450090/save-the-image-painted-by-javafx-to-the-disk) which had a great way of saving images/SVG of canvases taken in JavaFX and sending them to the disk. I can call from later on and add them to the canvas or pane to be seen when hovered over. I still need to add work on adding the tooltip to the beam shape line plot to display the y values of the left and right boundary of the beam shape.
