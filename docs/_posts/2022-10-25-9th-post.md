Tripoli Post #9

So for this week I contined working on the tooltip for the beam shape line plot. I was able to implement the tooltip to display the correct y axis data on the beam shape line plot at where the red dots are located indicating the left boundary and right boundary of the beams plot. I did have struggles trying to implement the tooltip when trying to indicate the correct location on the screen to display the information. In the setToolTips method on line 176 of BeamShapeLinePlot.java, I had changed a few things to only trigger when in the approximate location of the red dots. I realized the points between each index was too small to accurately have the cursor hit and stay on the specific location on the screen, So I expanded the index's trigger area to handle that issue. 

Next I am moving on to try and implement saving a SVG/PNG of the beam shape and g-beam line plots as they are generated in the PeakCentreLinePlot class. I will try doing this borrowing how it is kind of done in SQUID when saving a SVG of a graph/plot worked on in SQUID.
