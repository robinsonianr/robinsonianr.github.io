Tripoli Post #2

So this week, I was trying to work on adding the JavaFX tooltips feature to the peak shapes line plot. Specifically, the PeakCentre line plot, to get an idea of how to add the thumbnails of the beam shape line plot and the g-beam line plot. Next would be adding the tooltip to the beam shape line plot where the tip would display the value at the red dots on the line plot. I still need to do more work on the current tooltip added to the peakcentre line plot, some of the functionality needs refinements.

Also, this week I had a meeting with every involved with Tripoli discussing what we have and what is to be done next. It was great getting feedback on the contributions I have already made towards the peak shapes component of Tripoli. Now just waiting on the new Matlab code to continue refining more of the peak math in java to handle the faraday and axial data retrieved from mass spectrometers.
