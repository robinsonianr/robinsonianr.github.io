Tripoli Post #12

For this week, I was able to get snapshots/images of the beam and g-beam line plots to be saved. It took some time to get it to work because the way to import JavaFX.embeded.swing had changed after doing some research. This import allows me to take a writable image and convert it into a rendered image that can be used later on within Tripoli. As the peak centre line plot is generated, the beam and g-beam line plots are snapshotted and converted to rendered images and saved to a list of rendered images. The lists can be accessed at any time based on the current collection of peak centre files.

Next, I am working on how to resize the rendered image and place them over the correct index on the peak centre line plot. I have done a little research on how they do it but I am not sure if the canvas will accept rendered images over java images.
