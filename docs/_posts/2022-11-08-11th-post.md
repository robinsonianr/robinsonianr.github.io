Tripoli Post #11

This week I am still recovering from covid. I have been doing some research on saving an image of the canvas I want to use later on the peak centre line plot. The last meeting i ahd Dr. Bowring heleped me find some good resources to work on how to implement taking a pciture of a canvase and saving it to the pc's hardrive. From the resources it turns out that javafx has some features builtin to easily take an image of a canvas you want to save. This resources [JavaFX Save Images](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69321301/javafx-save-canvas-to-png-file) shows a small example of how it can be used in practice, and I will probably be following along this and a few other resources to implement saving the images of the canvases.
