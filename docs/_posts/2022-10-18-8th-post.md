Tripoli Post #8

This week I am continuing my research on implementing how to save SVG/png feature into Tripoli. I am trying to figure out the best way to use the feature with what I already have implemented. A possible method would be to save an SVG/png of the beam shape and g-beam shape line plots when they are created with the function proccessDataFileAndShowPlotsOfPeakshapes() on line 339 in peakShapesPlotController.java. Or I could do it in the function proccesFilesAndShowPeakCentre() on line 240 because it is processing all the graphs that I will need to see the peak centre line plot. 

For now, I am going to try and finish up adding the tooltip feature to the beam shape line plot to have at least something displayed for that line plot. The hardest part of implementing this is indexing the x position because it is not evenly spaced like the peak centre line plot, but It can still be done.
