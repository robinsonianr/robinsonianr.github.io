Tripoli Post #5


This week I was not able to get much done, I have been doing many assignments for other classes and prepareing for incoming exams. I still am working on the tooltip feature in the peakshape part of Tripoli, I am still planning to try and implement the previous mouse position variable to fix the tool tip from not hiding when I want it to When i change the cursor position within the graph. I am hoping after this week I can implement the ideas that i have into the code and see if it works. I still need to do research on wheather I can add canvases as a tooltip or maybe there might be another solution to add a pop up on the screen that allows canvases to show.
